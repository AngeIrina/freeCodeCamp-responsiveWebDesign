        <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform that enables version control and collaboration. Allows you and others to collaborate on projects from anywhere.</p>
        <p>Collaborative work, one of the fundamental features of GitHub, is made possible by the open source software Git, on which GitHub is based.</p>
        <p>Key benefits of GitHub:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open source communities</li>
          <li>Version control</li>
          <li>Project portfolio</li>
          <li>Team collaboration</li>
        </ul>

         <p>Git is a version control system that keeps track of changes to files. It's especially useful when you and a group of people are making changes to the same files at the same time.</p>
        <p>Typically, to do this in a Git-based workflow, you would do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a branch from the main copy of files you (and your collaborators) are working on.</li>
          <li>Make changes to files independently and securely in your own personal branch.</li>
          <li>Dejar que Git fusione mediante combinación y de forma inteligente los cambios específicos en la copia principal de archivos, de modo que los cambios no afecten a las actualizaciones de otras personas.</li>
          <li>Let Git keep track of your changes and those of other people, so everyone keeps working on the most up-to-date version of the project.</li>
        </ul>

         <p>GitHub is a platform where you can store, share, and work together with other users to write code.</p>
        <p>Storing your code in a "repository" on GitHub allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Present or share work.</li>
          <li>Track and manage code changes over time.</li>
          <li>Let other users review the code and make suggestions to improve it.</li>
          <li>Collaborate on a shared project, without worrying that changes will affect collaborators' work before you are ready to integrate them.</li>
        </ul>

        <header>How do Git and GitHub work together?</header>
         <p>When you upload files to GitHub, you store them in a "Git repository." This means that when you make changes (or "commits") to files on GitHub, Git will automatically start to track and manage the changes.

There are many Git-related actions you can complete on GitHub right in the browser, such as creating a Git repository, creating branches, and uploading and editing files.

However, most people work on their files locally (on their own computer), then continually sync these local changes, and all related Git data, to the "remote" central repository on GitHub. There are many tools you can use to do this, such as GitHub Desktop.</p>
        <p>When you start collaborating with others and you all need to work on the same repository at the same time, you will continually do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pull all the most recent changes made by collaborators from the remote repository on GitHub.</li>
          <li>Push changes back to the same remote repository on GitHub.</li>
        </ul>

         <p>
To get started with GitHub, you'll need to create a free personal account on GitHub.com and verify your email address.</p>
        <p>Each person using GitHub.com will need to log in to a personal account. Your personal account is your identity on GitHub.com and has a username and profile.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vaya a https://github.com/.</li>
          <li>Haga clic en Registrarse.</li>
          <li>Siga los pasos.</li>
